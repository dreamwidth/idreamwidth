2.0 - Description

iDreamwidth is a mobile client for Dreamwidth for Apple's iOS devices, iOS 3+.  The client allows a user to post entries to their journals and communities, edit past entries, and read recent posts made by users they have subscribed to on their Reading Page.  iDreamwidth uses the flat-interface protocol and should be able to also work with LiveJournal (though this feature is not currently enabled).

The version of iDreamwidth you are currently is the source code as of the end of Google's Summer of Code 2010.  To see a more recent version of the code, please visit the application's code site at http://code.google.com/p/idreamwidth/.
